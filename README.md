**IDM** which represents for Integrator, Data Provider and Model is core of Interactor layer which makes your app independently with Database and external agency via Data Provider; build an unidirectional data flow by merging Data Provider; manage async tasks by Integrator queue. This pattern will help you to build a better architecture and provide a set of utilities to handle complex business logic of your app.

## Why IDMCore?

- **Make a clean structure**: Apply the principles of design, **IDMCore** makes your application become *easily to change*, *flexibly to scale*. It also enhances unit test capability, optimizes reuse of the parts of source code. It is especially compatible with most of today's popular application architectures from **MVC**, **MVP** to **VIPER**.

  * With **MVC**, the framework helps to eliminate the problems of *massive view controllers* which MVC often encounters, standardizes display loading and error warnings that many programmers feel uncomfortable.

  * With **MVP** and **VIPER**, the framework helps to eliminate repeatable delegate methods between presenter and view whose sole purpose is forward a signal, such as *startLoading*, *successHandling* or *errorHandling*.

  *Writing code follows **IDMFoundation** and IDMCore Template is a great way to quickly create a flow (from requesting to handling response data).*

- **Unidirectional data flow**: The data flow will always go in one direction from the View to Bussiness Integrator to DataProvider. It makes it easy to control errors when they are occurs, readable and understandable. In addition, each data provider is responsible for retrieving the data required by the Integrator, so you can completely replace it with another one with similar functionality, or aggregate data from multiple different data providers. Your application will be independent of the data sources that will help you ***mock up test data*** easily.

- **Manage tasks**: Handling interdependent tasks, asynchronously tasks easily through IntegrationCall. Scheduling data providers lets you control tasks without the need to add a large library just to manage tasks.

## How IDMCore?

### Installation

- For generic customize: using pure **IDMCore**

IDMCore is available through CocoaPods. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
  pod 'IDMCore'
```

- For common iOS applications: using **IDMFoundation** which can find here: https://github.com/congncif/IDMFoundation

```ruby
  pod 'IDMFoundation/Core'
  pod 'IDMFoundation/RequestParameter'
  pod 'IDMFoundation/Alamofire'
  pod 'IDMFoundation/ObjectMapper'
  pod 'IDMFoundation/MBProgressHUD'
```

### Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 8.3+
- Swift 3.1+

### Getting started

**IDMFoundation**üê¥ together with **ViewStateCore**üê• and **ModuleX**üê∂ will make your application to ***absolute control***. üí™üí™üí™
